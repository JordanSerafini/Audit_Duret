' === LEGENDE RACI ===
legend bottom right
  **MATRICE RACI - LEGENDE**

  <back:RACI_R>  R  </back> **RESPONSIBLE** - Realise l'activite (execute)
  <back:RACI_A>  A  </back> **ACCOUNTABLE** - Garant du resultat (decide)
  <back:RACI_C>  C  </back> **CONSULTED** - Consulte pour avis (bidirectionnel)
  <back:RACI_I>  I  </back> **INFORMED** - Informe des resultats (unidirectionnel)

  --
  **REGLES:**
  - 1 seul A (Accountable) par activite
  - Plusieurs R possibles (travail collaboratif)
  - C/I selon besoins communication
  - CODIR toujours A sur jalons GO/NO-GO
  - Chef Projet toujours R sur reporting
  - Sponsors A sur recette metier

  **PRINCIPES GOUVERNANCE:**

  EMO_CRITICAL **Escalades:**
  - Niveau 1: Super-users → Sponsors (quotidien)
  - Niveau 2: Sponsors → Chef Projet (hebdo)
  - Niveau 3: Chef Projet → CODIR (mensuel)

  EMO_WARNING **Decisions majeures (A = CODIR obligatoire):**
  - Budget >10K€ non prevu
  - Retard planning >2 semaines
  - Changement perimetre fonctionnel
  - Tous jalons GO/NO-GO

  EMO_SUCCESS **Autonomie Sponsors (A local):**
  - Validation besoins metier
  - Recette fonctionnelle
  - Priorisation backlog service
  - Formation/communication equipe
